Kutalla takes state-of-the-art data science to aggregate and analyse activity data from entire companies to make qualitative statements about the processes happening in an organization.\n\nYannick engineered the platform which enables Kutalla to process and aggregate all customer data in a GDPR and DSGVO compliant manner. Once the pilot was complete and data started coming in, Yannick lead the data science engineering to find patterns and tool chains in company & department behaviour to identify and eliminate labour-intensive tasks.\n\nYannick designed a large-scale data aggregation architecture in SQL, as well as front-end and back-end software to gather data into Kutalla’s format."},{title:"Full-Stack Engineer – Eventmatch iOS App & REST Server<br />Q2 2019 – Q3 2019",summary:"Swift, iOS, Django, REST, SQL, Stripe, Google Cloud Platform",more:"Eventmatch is a TUM start-up founded in 2017 aimed at bringing people together in the real world.

For example, a face detection API is used for rudimentary filtering, showing children only the items to purchase which they’re allowed to buy. The project was based on a Raspberry Pi integrated touchscreen system.\n\nAs lead developer for this project, Yannick designed an architecture to facilitate the needs of this dynamic interface. Yannick ensured an easily accessible UI which allows the user to select items to be dropped on the cash register’s conveyor belt. The UI is optimized and filtered according to facial features returned by Microsoft’s Face API."},{title:"Front-End Developer – Dynamic QML Interfaces<br />Q3 2015",summary:"Qt5, QML, C++, Javascript, Raspberry Pi",more:"HARTING KGaA is a hidden champion, providing the entire world with industrial connectors, electrical and more.

This new structure allows a dynamic assortment of new technology showcases to be controlled and configured from a single Android device.\n\nYannick’s role was to build the generic architecture to facilitate dynamic and changing UIs for all sorts of technologies. This framework is future-proof, and allows new technologies to be added with simple XML files. These files are dynamically loaded to create an ever-changing UI on an Android tablet.
